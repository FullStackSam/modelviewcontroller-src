Compositing Model
-----------------

**Addressed Need: Aggregation of information from submodels.**

We will create a trivial address book application whose data sources are two
comma-separated (CSV) files and one XML file. The objective is to have a View
that can display data regardless of the number of sources, and that allows
extension to other storage formats without excessive modifications. The final
application is a simple Qt ListWidget with one name and telephone number per
each row

The Model layer is composed of three classes: two of them provide readonly
access to each file format (CSV or XML). The third uses the previous two,
manipulating the data for more convenient handling, in this case merging. The
resulting class AddressBook is a Compositing Model: it acts both as a Model for
its View (the ``AddressBookView``) and as a View for its submodels instances

The code for class ``AddressBookCSV`` is here shown to illustrate the rather
trivial interface supported by all Model objects. The common base class
BaseModel provides notification services by implementing the well known methods
``register``, ``unregister``, ``notifyListeners``, and the listeners set, as shown in
Traditional MVC::

   class AddressBookCSV(BaseModel):
       def __init__(self, filename):
           super(AddressBookCSV, self).__init__()
           self._filename = filename

       def numEntries(self):
           try:
               return len(open(self._filename, "r").readlines())
           except:
               return 0

       def getEntry(self, entry_number):
           try:
               line = open(self._filename, "r").readlines()[entry_number]
               name, phone = line.split(',')
               return { 'name' : name.strip(), 'phone' : phone.strip()}
           except:
               raise IndexError("Invalid entry %d" % entry_number)


The code for the View is simplified by the fact that there's no Controller. No
modifications are allowed on our Models, so no GUI events need to be handled::

    class AddressBookView(QtGui.QListWidget):
        def __init__(self, model, *args, **kwargs):
            super(QtGui.QListWidget, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self._model = model

            self._model.register(self)

The ``notify`` method extracts data from the Model and repopulates the ListWidget
after clearing it. As a general rule, this method is rather aggressive and may
introduce flickering or loss of selection of the List items. Solving these
issues is beyond the scope of this example. Additionally, the List does not
need regular refresh cycles, because the Models are readonly and parsed only
once at startup::

    class AddressBookView(QtGui.QListWidget):
        # ...
        def notify(self):
            self.clear()

            for i in range(self._model.numEntries()):
                entry = self._model.getEntry(i)
                string = "%s (%s)" % (entry["name"], entry["phone"])
                self.addItem(string)

Note how the View is agnostic of the actual Model type, and can render data
from either ``AddressBookCSV`` or ``AddressBookXML``. This is expected, as we
are programming against an interface. The Compositing Model class ``AddressBook``
implements the same interface and will therefore be rendered transparently by
the ``AddressBookView``. 

The ``AddressBook`` class accepts an arbitrary number of Models at initialization,
and registers as a listener on each of them. The interface expected by
``AddressBookView`` is reimplemented, deriving the data from the composition of
the submodels ::

   class AddressBook(BaseModel):
       def __init__(self, models):
           super(AddressBook, self).__init__()

           self._models = models

           for m in self._models:
               m.register(self)

The total number of entries is trivially the sum of the number of entries
provided by each submodel ::

    class AddressBook(BaseModel):
        # ...
        def numEntries(self):
            return sum([m.numEntries() for m in self._models])


To get a specific entry, we need to map the absolute entry number to the
relative entry number in a specific submodel, keeping into account the number
of elements in each submodel. We define the accumulate routine to compensate
for the lack of it in python2 ::

    class AddressBook(BaseModel):
        # ...
        def getEntry(self, entry_number):
            def accumulate(l):
                current_total = 0
                res = []
                for i in l:
                    current_total += i
                    res.append(current_total)
                return res
            accumulated = accumulate([m.numEntries() for m in self._models])
            source_idx = map(lambda x: x <= entry_number,
                             accumulated).index(False)
            try:
                return self._models[source_idx].getEntry(
                                       entry_number - accumulated[source_idx]
                                       )
            except:
                raise IndexError("Invalid entry %d" % entry_number)

Finally, when any of the submodels notify a change, the Compositing Model
should just perform a notification to its listener, in our case the
``AddressBookView`` ::

    class AddressBook(BaseModel):
        # ...
        def notify(self):
            self.notifyListeners()

The application main routine creates the three datasource models, and passes
them to the Compositing Model ``AddressBook``, which is then passed to the View ::

   csv1_model = AddressBookCSV("file1.csv")
   xml_model = AddressBookXML("file.xml")
   csv2_model = AddressBookCSV("file2.csv")

   address_book = AddressBook([csv1_model, xml_model, csv2_model])

   view = AddressBookView(address_book)

In this case, the Compositing Model is performing union of homogeneous
information originating from different sources, but this is not the only case
where a Compositing Model can be useful. Another example is to extract relevant
information from different Models and present them in an easy to query FaÃ§ade.
These Models are normally conceived to simplify access from a View with
specific presentation objectives. 

A compositing model can also compose objects of different nature that need to be joined
through a complex relation. For example, a CustomerHistory Model could combine two Models:
Customer and Orders. In this sense, the Model may follow the needs of the View, because
the existence of this Model object is implied by the specific View needs to represent
this particular data aggregate.
