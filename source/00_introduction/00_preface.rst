Preface
=======

I started writing this book as an accident. Initially, I wanted to write a
series of blog posts to describe Model View Controller and a few related
patterns.  As I gathered more and more information from the net and my personal
experience, I suddenly found out that the amount and structure of what I wrote
was beyond the scope of a blog, hence the decision to re-label it as a book. I
am happy with the decision, because it gives me now freedom to add material I
would not have added before.


This works presents and enriches design solutions, best practices, and
experiments made available by countless blog posts and comments.  Being a work
in progress, there's still a lot to be done. Please be patient, but feel free
to send me feedback, push requests and take advantage of the material already
present.  This book is released under GFDL license. 

Why is this book free?
----------------------

For three reasons:

 - I learned most of the material here presented from the net. 
   It was my personal effort to organize this knowledge, but I had
   a lower startup barrier.

 - I already `published a book with a commercial publisher <http://www.amazon.com/Computing-Comparative-Microbial-Genomics-Microbiologists/dp/1849967636>`_, 
   and from my experience and math, I think that if I put a book on the 
   web and accept donations I would probably get more money and feedback than
   going through a publisher.

 - This book is part of my portfolio as a professional in software development
   and design, and I am proud to focus on a personal project to increase my
   competences.

That said, I gladly accept donations:

 - on `GratiPay <https://gratipay.com/StefanoBorini/>`_
 - on `bitcoin <bitcoin:13RQmVjRKVbQnVmuVsFxHjycgo7cTaaZ3w>`_
 - on PayPal (using my email address stefano.borini at ferrara dot linux dot it)

I also have a personal website at http://forthescience.org where you can find
more information about me, my curriculum and activities.
