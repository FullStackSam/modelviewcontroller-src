Hierarchic MVC
=================

Until now, we have seen MVC applied to a single triad. This works well for
individual widgets and dialogs, but how do we apply and scale MVC to an
application level?  Communication between controllers

Application composed of tens, or hundreds of triads. Can we organize them 
somehow? Do we need to? Yes we do.
