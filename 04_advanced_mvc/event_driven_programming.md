Explain how MVC naturally ends up with an event driven model.
Explain the complexity of debugging (e.g. backtraces all coming from the event
loop)

Behavior is no longer characterized by code alone. Emergent behavior arises from
the potentially asynchronous interaction among objects, communicating through
events. The communication network being mutable. This results in extremely 
complex, hard to understand, hard to debug designs.
