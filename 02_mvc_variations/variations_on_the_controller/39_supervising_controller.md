# Supervising Controller

### Motivation

Toolkits and UI frameworks can provide declarative generation of a View with
direct binding (see Variations on the Triad: Data Binding) between data 
in the Model and a corresponding Widget in the generated View. This declarative 
approach can simplify the deployment of a View, but can be of limited expressive power.

Supervising Controller complements the declarative View to address complex logic that
the View is unable to handle.
